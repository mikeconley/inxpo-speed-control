# INXPO Speed Control

The new AirMozilla uses INXPO / onlineexperiences.com as our video host. Over the years, I've gotten used to watching pre-recorded AirMozilla videos at > 1.0x speed, but unfortunately, the INXPO video player doesn't expose the ability to control playback rate.

This WebExtension fixes that. Only tested on https://airmo.mozilla.org, and only on a few videos.
